# 🔧 Fix GitHub Secrets - Step by Step Guide

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your tests are failing with this error:
```
Error: page.goto: net::ERR_ABORTED at name: URLSecret: https://app-staging.vivacityapp.com
```

**Root Cause:** The `URL` GitHub Secret is **NOT SET** or is empty.

---

## ✅ Solution: Set Up GitHub Secrets

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Secrets Settings

Click this link to open the secrets page:
**https://github.com/kcPauvivacity/Admin-automation-test-CICD/settings/secrets/actions**

Or manually navigate:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/kcPauvivacity/Admin-automation-test-CICD
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Click **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** (left sidebar)

---

### Step 2: Add or Update These Secrets

You need to create/update **3 secrets**:

#### Secret 1: URL
- Click **"New repository secret"** (or edit if exists)
- Name: `URL`
- Value: `https://app-staging.vivacityapp.com`
- Click **"Add secret"**

#### Secret 2: USERNAME
- Click **"New repository secret"** (or edit if exists)
- Name: `USERNAME`
- Value: `kc@vivacityapp.com`
- Click **"Add secret"**

#### Secret 3: PASSWORD
- Click **"New repository secret"** (or edit if exists)
- Name: `PASSWORD`
- Value: `PAOpaopao@9696` (use your actual password)
- Click **"Add secret"**

---

### Step 3: Verify Secrets Are Set

After adding all 3 secrets, you should see:
- ✅ URL
- ✅ USERNAME
- ✅ PASSWORD

**Important:** You won't be able to see the values (they're hidden for security), but the names should be visible.

---

### Step 4: Run Tests Again

1. Go to: https://github.com/kcPauvivacity/Admin-automation-test-CICD/actions/workflows/playwright-tests.yml
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Select branch: **main**
4. Click **"Run workflow"** (green button)

The debug step will now show:
```
✅ URL is set: true
✅ USERNAME is set: true
✅ PASSWORD is set: true
```

## 📸 Screenshots/Videos Issue

The email says "Check attached HTML report for screenshots and videos" but you can't see them. Here's why:

### Where to Find Screenshots/Videos:

**Option 1: Download from GitHub Actions**
1. Go to the completed workflow run
2. Scroll to bottom → **Artifacts** section
3. Download **"playwright-report"** zip file
4. Unzip and open `index.html`
5. Click on failed tests → Screenshots and videos will be there

**Option 2: Wait for Next Version**
We can enhance the email to include screenshots directly in the email body (advanced feature).

## 🔍 Why Tests Pass Locally But Fail in CI

### Local Environment:
```typescript
// From tests/helpers/auth.helper.ts
export const LOGIN_URL = process.env.URL || 'https://app-staging.vivacityapp.com';
```

When you run tests locally:
- `process.env.URL` is **undefined**
- So it uses the **fallback** → `'https://app-staging.vivacityapp.com'`
- ✅ Tests work!

### CI Environment (Before Fix):
- `process.env.URL` is **undefined** (secret not set)
- Uses fallback → `'https://app-staging.vivacityapp.com'`
- But GitHub Actions environment has issues with the URL
- ❌ Tests fail with network error!

### CI Environment (After Fix):
- `process.env.URL` = `'https://app-staging.vivacityapp.com'` (from secret)
- ✅ Tests should work!

---

## 🎯 Expected Result After Fix

Once you set the secrets and run tests again, you should see:

1. ✅ All tests pass (or most pass)
2. ✅ Email shows correct statistics
3. ✅ No more "URLSecret" errors
4. ✅ Screenshots/videos available in downloaded HTML report

---

## 🆘 If Tests Still Fail After Setting Secrets

Check these in the workflow run logs:

1. **Debug step output** - Should show "true" for all secrets
2. **Error messages** - Look for different error types:
   - Authentication errors → Password might be wrong
   - Timeout errors → Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`
   - Element not found → Selectors might need updating

3. **Download HTML report** to see visual evidence of failures
